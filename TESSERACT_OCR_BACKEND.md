# Tesseract OCR Backend for Tekisuto

This document describes the new Tesseract OCR backend integration for the Tekisuto application.

## Overview

Tesseract OCR is an open-source optical character recognition engine that provides accurate text recognition across multiple languages. This implementation adds Tesseract OCR as an alternative OCR backend in Tekisuto, alongside the existing ML Kit, Cloud OCR, and Google Lens options.

## Features

- Support for all languages already available in Tekisuto
- Automatic downloading of language data files as needed
- Integration with the existing profile system
- Optimized text processing for better recognition results

## Usage

1. Open Tekisuto and go to OCR Settings
2. Select "Tesseract OCR" from the OCR Service dropdown menu
3. Choose your preferred language
4. Save the settings to your profile (optional)

## Technical Implementation

The Tesseract OCR backend is implemented using the Tesseract4Android library, which provides Android-compatible bindings for the Tesseract OCR engine. When you select Tesseract as your OCR service, the app will:

1. Check if the required language data file is available in the app's external storage
2. Download the language data file from the Tesseract GitHub repository if needed
3. Initialize the Tesseract engine with the selected language
4. Process screenshots using the Tesseract API for text recognition

## Language Support

Tesseract OCR supports all languages that are available in Tekisuto:

- English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Chinese
- Devanagari (Hindi, Sanskrit, etc.)
- Japanese
- Korean

## Advantages over Other OCR Methods

- **Privacy**: Tesseract OCR processes everything on-device with no data sent to external servers
- **Offline operation**: Works without an internet connection
- **Customizable**: Can be fine-tuned for specific use cases
- **Open-source**: Transparent implementation and community support

## Performance Considerations

- Tesseract OCR may be slower than ML Kit for initial processing
- First-time use requires downloading language data files
- Memory usage may be higher than other OCR methods

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Tesseract OCR:

1. Check that the app has internet access for downloading language files
2. Ensure the app has sufficient storage space
3. Try restarting the app if language files fail to download
4. For persistent issues, switch to another OCR method temporarily

## Future Improvements

Future updates may include:

- Pre-packaged language data files to avoid downloads
- Advanced OCR settings for fine-tuning recognition
- Additional language support
- Integration with custom trained Tesseract models
